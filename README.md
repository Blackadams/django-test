# Django Blog
  * Django Blog is a blog type website built using Django
  * **Disclaimers** Django Blog is built off a tutorial by Corey Schafer. Check out his tube channel to learn how to Python/Django/Flask/etc.

# OverView
  * The tutorial provides a very solid overview on how to implement web framework basics using Django, such as ORM to databases, CRUD, and MVT( MVC ) architecture.

  * Special features of Django are also taught such as how static files (css, and javascript) are served, how django admin, and user auth works, and how Django manage.py allows the deployment of the app, as well as migrating the ORM to database.

  * Rather a blog website, it's more of a forum-esque website where anyone who register can make posts.


# Technologies
  * Django 2.2.3 - The day when regex urls don't matter anymore
  * Python 3.7.3 - Missed me with that Python 2.7

# Differences from Tutorial
  * Corey uses Bootstrap, There is no bootstrap in this project, all CSS is OEM.
